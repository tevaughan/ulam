ulam
====

An (UNFINISHED!) application to render the [Ulam
spiral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral) in various ways.
 - The starting number (any positive integer at the center of the spiral) may
   be chosen.
 - The starting direction (right, up, left, or down) may be chosen.
 - The sense of wrapping (clockwise or counter-clockwise) may be chosen.
 - The size of the spiral may be chosen.

So far, what has been implemented are the command-line interface and the code
that calculates the prime factorization of every natural number that will be
needed to construct the spiral.

Sieve of Eratosthenes
---------------------

As a part of the program, I have implemented my own, custom version of the
Sieve of Eratosthenes. It not only efficiently finds all of the primes up to a
limit but also efficiently constructs the prime factorization of every natural
number up to the limit.

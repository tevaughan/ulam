An application to render the Ulam spiral in various ways.
 - The starting number (any positive integer at the center of the spiral) may
   be chosen.
 - The starting direction (right, up, left, or down) may be chosen.
 - The sense of wrapping (clockwise or counter-clockwise) may be chosen.
 - The size of the spiral may be chosen.

Sieve of Eratosthenes
---------------------

As a part of the program, I have implemented my own, custom version of the
Sieve of Eratosthenes. It not only efficiently finds all of the primes up to a
limit but also efficiently constructs the prime factorization of every natural
number up to the limit.
